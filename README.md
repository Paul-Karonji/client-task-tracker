## About
Client Task Tracker is a front-end application to help manage client tasks: create tasks, assign them to clients or team members, set statuses, and maintain simple progress tracking. It is intended to be simple to run locally for demos, local development, or to pair with a backend API.

## Screenshots
Below are placeholder screenshots showing the app UI. These are simple SVG placeholders to be replaced with real screenshots later.

  Alt: "Task detail view — placeholder"

*Figure 2 — Task detail (placeholder)*

## Demo
A lightweight animated placeholder showing the interaction flow. This is an animated SVG used as a demo/GIF placeholder:

Notes:
- Replace the SVG placeholders with real PNG/JPEG/GIF assets when you have screenshots or an actual demo GIF.
- Files are placed under assets/screenshots/ and assets/gifs/ for easy replacement.
